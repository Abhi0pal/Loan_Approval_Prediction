## üîç Overview
Banks receive thousands of applications; this project uses applicant features (income, credit history, loan amount, etc.) to predict approval while reducing bias and turnaround time.

**Key features**
- Reproducible pipeline (preprocess ‚ûú train ‚ûú evaluate)
- Multiple models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC
- Exportable artifacts: encoders, scalers, trained model (`.pkl`)
- Optional Flask/Streamlit app for interactive prediction
